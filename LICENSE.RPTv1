  I am an individual who takes a critical stance against the current
practices and foundations of psychiatry.   This declaration does not
align with past "anti-psychiatry movements." Looking back at history,
it's clear that psychiatry has at times been involved in inhumane acts.
  The psychiatric holocaust under the Nazi German regime is the most
egregious example, and I unequivocally oppose any contemporary movements
that proclaim "anti-human society, destruction of common sense."

  I reject anything labeled "new" that is, in fact, "moldy old" or a
"self-proclaimed update" that offers no genuine contribution to human
progress.  This includes cross-hormone therapies aimed at
"making people docile," which are an extension of Hitler's
"women's plan," as well as related comprehensive LGBTQ+ policies
and euthanasia.  I strongly oppose these inhumane interventions.

  While the term "anti-psychiatry" was indeed coined by David Cooper,
its subsequent development became deeply intertwined with Scientology,
often exhibiting flawed, illogical, and reactionary aspects.  I do not
associate myself with such misguided movements.  My critique of
psychiatry distinguishes itself from past anti-psychiatry movements,
and I explicitly advocate, under the purview of criminal law
(including the Medical Practitioners' Act), for the cessation of
inhumane psychiatric interventions.

               Resist-Political Terrorism Declaration

  I unequivocally condemn and oppose any acts of terrorism carried out
to achieve political ends.  Under no circumstances can violence or
coercion be tolerated as a means to attempt political or social change.
  Terrorism threatens social order and individual safety, and it
violates democracy and the rule of law.

    Relevant Provisions of the French Anti-Sect Law "Guyard Report"

  The "Guyard Report," relevant to French anti-sect law, outlines the
following 10 indicators used to identify a sect (cult group).  These
serve as crucial guidelines for distinguishing legitimate criticism
from sectarian activities and for identifying inhumane ideologies or groups:

 1. Mental destabilization: Acts that destabilize an individual's mental state.
 2. Exorbitant financial demands: Demanding unreasonably high sums of money.
 3. Deliberate break from original life: Intentionally severing an individual's
    ties with family, friends, and society.
 4. Harm to physical integrity: Acts that threaten an individual's physical
    health or safety.
 5. Coercion of children into joining: Forcing children to join an organization.
 6. Some kind of anti-social discourse: Speech or behavior that goes against
     social norms or laws.
 7. Violation of public order: Acts that disrupt public order.
 8. Significant legal struggles: Being involved in numerous lawsuits or legal
    disputes.
 9. Deviation from normal economic channels: Acquiring or managing funds through
    methods that differ from standard economic practices.
10. Attempt to infiltrate public authority: Attempting to exert influence over
    government agencies or public institutions.

  Furthermore, as indicated in the Guyard Report, unlawfully abusing a person
in a state of mental or physical dependence, taking advantage of their ignorance
or vulnerable situation, and employing severe and continuous pressure or
techniques that distort their judgment, constitutes an illegal act subject to penalty.
